Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting
things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility; it
results from some ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always
badâ€” at an existential level, it is my body rebelling against its
entrapment.

--Nassim Taleb - Antifragile
