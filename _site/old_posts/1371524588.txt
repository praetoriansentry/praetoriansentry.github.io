Having spoken at hundreds of funerals in my lifetime, I have
discovered that final remarks relate a great deal about the deceased.
It would be a fascinating experience to hear, in advance, what will be
said in our eulogy.  Few words are wasted over one&rsquo;s academic
achievements, professional career, or wealth.  Families receive major
play, but the most spotlighted characteristic is how the dearly
departed treated others.
