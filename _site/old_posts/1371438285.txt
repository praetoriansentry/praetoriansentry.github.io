Although we regularly treat the terms as if they are equals, there is
a difference between admiration (popularity) and respect.  The former
has to do with positive, outward attributes; the latter is a positive
recognition of one's inner strength and character.  We admire
celebrities, but we don't necessarily respect them.  We respect
great teachers, but we don't always like them
