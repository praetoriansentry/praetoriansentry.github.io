In every senior job I've had Iâ€™ve tried to create an environment of
professionalism and the very highest standards. When it was necessary
to get a job done, I expected my subordinates to work around the
clock. When that was not necessary, I wanted them to work normal
hours, go home at a decent time, play with the kids, enjoy family and
friends, read a novel, clear their heads, daydream, and refresh
themselves. I wanted them to have a life outside the office. I am
paying them for the quality of their work, not for the hours they
work. That kind of environment has always produced the best results
for me.
