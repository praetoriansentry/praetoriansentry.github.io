After writing the first quine in [[./2019-02-29-quine.org][bash]], I decided to mess around with
this a little bit more. I wanted to do two things. First, I wanted to
see if I could add my own contact information to the quine so that it
could be used on a business card. Second, I was interested to see if I
could do anything to make the code even more self-referential. So I
tried to add the hash of the code into the code itself.

This is what I ended up with:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/praetoriansentry/8b88b6ec0d57f5f8ae10aea2223f4a4e.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

The idea of having a source code file like this that references it's
own hash is very weird and cool. In most cases, a file can't contain
it's own hash because if the file changes, the hash changes. Since the
hash is part of the file, when you go to put the hash in the file, the
resulting has of the file would also change so it would never match
up.

I wrote this version in JavaScript, since I was thinking about putting
it on a business card, JavaScript is a very common language and pretty
easy to understand. After getting the basic quine working, I added a
placeholder for a CRC32 hash and used a go program brute-force a
CRC32 collision.

One interesting behavior of this program is that it didn't use 100% of
the CPU. What I found was that doing various types of string
concatenation caused a big slowdown. I experimented with a few
different ways of doing things like ~fmt.Sprint~, ~text.Template~, and
~strings.Join~. They were all kind of slow. I think if I wanted to
speed things up, I would have needed to treat the string like an array
and just overwrite part of the string with different hash
values. Then, under the hood, there would be no need for concatenation
or growing the string.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/praetoriansentry/03b6dc2e68e174ffd8168aef7d85f910.js"></script>
#+END_EXPORT

In practice, finding the CRC32 collision even by ignorant brute force
was pretty fast, so I didn't bother trying to optimize the code.

One thing that I did learn was that CRC32 isn't just one specific
standard. It's an algorithm and there are different standards for the
underlying polynomial that's used during the calculation. For my case,
I just needed to match the standard that's used in the default ~crc32~
command line implementation on my system. In this case, it's the IEEE
standard.

In the end, I took the source code and dropped it into Illustrator to
make it fit on a card. Now if anyone ever type this out, they could
always verify they typed it correctly by verifying the CRC32.
