I forgot my wallet yesterday so I didn't have my access card when I
got to work. Fortunately, I know the facility code and card number for
my access card. I hadn't done this before, but I wanted to write a new
card for myself using the Proxmark. Here was my approach.

First I had to remember what the facility code and card number for my
access card were. In my case, I was lucky enough to have a picture of
my access card with the information on it. For the sake of
explanation, let's assume my Facility Code is ~74~ and my card number
is ~47777~.

After gathering that information, I had to figure out the exact
specification for 26bit HID ProxCards. Fortunately HID has a lot of
detailed information on their site. [[https://www.hidglobal.com/sites/default/files/hid-understanding_card_data_formats-wp-en.pdf][This reference]] was very useful. I
ended up referencing this diagram very carefully.

I wasn't entirely sure, but I just assumed the format for our cards as
going to be "standard." So the next step was to convert my card data
into that format.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Format:  P FFFFFFFF NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN P
Decimal: 0       76            47777 0
Binary:  0 01001010 1011101010100001 0
#+END_SRC

The parity bits are a simple way to check the integrity of the
data. The leading parity bit is even. That means the bit should be set
such that the total number of bits in the associated block is an even
number. The trailing parity bit is the opposite. There are two blocks
and two parity bits. The first 13 bits are the first block and the
last 13 bits are the second block.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Format:  P FFFFFFFFNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNN P
Binary:  0 010010101011 101010100001 0
Parity:  0 010010101011 101010100001 0
#+END_SRC

The first 13 bits have 6 1-bits, so the even parity bit should be
~0~. The ending 13 minutes have 5 1-bits, so the odd parity bit should
be 0.

Now we need to convert the binary number into a tag id that works with
Proxmark. The details of this get a little complicated since we're
emulating an HID card using a generic T5577 re-writeable card. There a
lot of details [[http://www.proxmark.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=1767][here]]. This is the particular diagram that's extremely
helpful for this case.

The whole stream is 44 bits in length where the bits that we computed
above would be all the way at the end.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Reference: 0000001 00000000001 P FFFFFFFF NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN P
Binary:    0000001 00000000001 0 01001010 1011101010100001 0
Binary:    10000000000100100101010111010101000010
Decimal:   137515857218
Hex:       2004957542
#+END_SRC

The final result here is a 38 bit number. In order to make my new
card, I'll have to take this 38-bit Tag Id and use Proxmark to write
that information to a new T5577 card. The command I'm using is ~lf hid
clone 2004957542~. Here is a screen shot of me cloning the tag and
also verifying that the data matches the FC and Card Number that I
expected.

At this point, my card works and I can go in and out of the office. I
suppose it would have been easier to borrow someone else's card, but
not quite as fun.
