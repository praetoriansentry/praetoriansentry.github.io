Although we regularly treat the terms as if they are equals, there is a difference between admiration (popularity) and respect.  The former has to do with positive, outward attributes; the latter is a positive recognition of one&rsquo;s inner strength and character.  We admire celebrities, but we don&rsquo;t necessarily respect them.  We respect great teachers, but we don&rsquo;t always like them
