Ralph Nader has a simple rule: people voting for war need to have at least one descendant (child or grandchild) exposed to combat. For the Romans, engineers needed to spend some time under the bridge they builtâ€” something that should be required of financial engineers today. The English went further and had the families of the engineers spend time with them under the bridge after it was built.
