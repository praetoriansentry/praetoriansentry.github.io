<p>
Last Friday, we had an all-day workshop lead by the <a href="https://growsmethod.com/">Grows Method</a>
team. I wanted to document my raw notes and reactions.
</p>

<p>
The format of the workshop is only partially lecture style, so my
notes are probably a little scattered. Overall, our team loved the
process. Being able to learn from slides, games, discussion,
activities was thoroughly engaging.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
As an industry, we're still having the same problems that we used to
have in the 80's. Agile has been around for 20 years now, but why
isn't agile itself agile? It hasn't changed in 20 years. Many
companies use agile ad something tacked on like cardboard spoilers on a
bad car. It won't change performance.
</p>

<p>
<b>Theme</b> Fast feedback, experimentation, and trace bullets are critical
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus Model</a> came up again: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent,
Proficient, and Expert. One idea that stuck out was that an expert
isn't just a more knowledgeable novice, they're way of thinking and
recognizing patterns is totally different. Even though in the real
world there aren't exact dividing lines, there are real distinctions
between the skill levels.
</p>

<p>
When a novice is working, they need more firm rules. E.g. for cooking,
you can't tell a novice, "cook until done." They don't know what done
means. They need more firm guidance. An expert could have an intuition
about when something is done, <span class="underline">even if they can't explain it</span>.
</p>

<p>
Novices also lack system thinking. They view themselves detached from
the system and they won't be able to see themselves as part of the
problem. When someone on the team has a bad day, the code has a bad
day. I think NxJ is pretty strong at recognizing this,
organizationally, but novices alone won't.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to our bias and decision making skills, I really liked
the analogy that our brain has bugs and we don't have the source
code. These bugs affect our decision making. Additionally, we have
faulty memory. "Every read is a write." When we remember something the
memory gets changed slightly.
</p>

<p>
Context is important. Everyone can't "do what Netflix does." We're not
all Netflix. The context is important. E.g. It's a <span class="underline">best practice</span> to
put the truck in front of the trailer. But that best practice doesn't
work when launching a boat. The best practice matters.
</p>

<p>
Generative Seeds:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Loops not lines
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Feedback loops, virtuous/vicious cycles, systems thinking skills,
OODA</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organic not Robotic
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Context, awareness, critical thinking skills</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intentional not accidental
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>deliberate experiments to drive changes to tech, culture, and
learning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actuals not Proxies
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seeking high-quality, local data for decisions, not convenient
low-quality proxies</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
I've heard of <a href="https://growsmethod.com/practices/TracerBullets.html">tracer bullets</a> before, but it feels like a good reminder
of how to develop. Figure out how to build something ends to end. Plan
and execute in lines that run end to end. Vs&#x2026; build the database
&#x2026; then build the service&#x2026; then build the front-end and try to get
them to work together.
</p>

<p>
Nobody likes change. We have to get everyone to agree to try.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have
gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to
be very intelligent.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Munger
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I liked the quote above. It reminded me of the rituals that we put in
place at Next Jump to avoid making stupid calls and to be brilliant in
the basics.
</p>

<p>
One of the activities we did was to play battle ship. We played two
rounds. In the first round, we fired all of our missiles at once. In
total our group sank 8 ships. In the second round, we played with
feedback from our opponent (normal style) and we sunk 48 ships in
total. It's a simple example, but it really made the point sink in
about the importance of feedback.
</p>

<p>
We think a lot about feedback at NxJ, but it was interesting to hear
another person talking about how important it is as well. "How can you
get feedback as fast as possible from as many sources as possible?" If
it's going to take a week to get feedback, how can we get that down to
a day or a 1/2 of a day.
</p>

<p>
One of the exercises that we did illustrated our inability see gradual
changes. We watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nL5ulsWMYc">videos</a> where something changed slowly. Most of the
group wasn't able to spot the change. It was a good illustration that
when things change slowly we might not notice.
</p>

<p>
The idea of gradual change extends to a lot of topics. E.g. if a
practice, meeting, or routine worked at first, but gradually stopped
working, we might not notice. We'll be like the frog that gets boiled.
</p>

<p>
We read a paper about OODA loops. Reading the paper served a few
purposes. We read it and learned about how OODA loops get stuck in OO
loops with no decision and no action. We also discussed the paper with
our group to understand the other things that our group picked up.
</p>

<p>
Some notes from OODA:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making a decision is not an action, but a process</li>
<li>The OODA Loop and get stuck</li>
<li>Competitive advantage comes from quickness over the full loop</li>
<li>Everyone orients differently</li>
<li>Information itself is messy</li>
<li>We usually assume there is a single decision maker. It's much worse</li>
</ul>

<p>
After talking about OODA, we talked a bit about biases especially in
terms of how we see information. We can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget%27s_theory_of_cognitive_development#Assimilation_and_Accommodation">assimilate it or accommodate it</a>.
</p>

<p>
One of the <a href="http://www.donaldegray.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SkillsForSoftwareSmokeJumpers.pdf">frameworks</a> mentioned for deal with our own biases and blind
spots was to think through this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I expect to see something, and I do.</li>
<li>I don’t expect to see something, and I don’t.</li>
<li>I expect to see something, but I don’t.</li>
<li>I don’t expect to see something, but I do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A lot of times, we won't see a big change, Black Swan, coming because
we're asking the wrong questions. E.g. who is going to win the war,
Motif or OpenLook.

<li>The code is never good enough. It always feel like a pile of garbage</li>

extensible" are red flags. You're <span class="underline">fortune telling</span> when you do
work like that. and we suck at predicting the future.</li>

<li>Compiler checks, tests are steps in the right direction, but there
are a lot more factors to consider: fit for purpose, do users want

<li>Estimating is fortune telling. Don't pad the estimates and don't
short change them.</li>
<li>Best practice is to extrapolate from past trends</li>
<li>Build a slice of functionality and ship it in a day</li>

<li>How to reflect
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not everyone is capable of really reflecting. Novice might have
the wrong lessons and takeaways</li>
<li>You have to just practice more before reflecting for some skills</li>

The second part of the day was more experiential. We did an activity
where we tried to build a tower out of spaghetti. We were competing to
build the tallest tower. It was a fun activity. Rather than over
thinking we just tried to build something rapidly and it worked out
well.
</p>

<p>
After building the initial tower, we took it down and tried to do it
again. Most teams did the same exact thing they did the first
time. Very little willingness to try something different and fail. It
was an interesting real-time failure to innovate where we ended up not
wanting to do worse.
</p>

<p>
After that, we played a card game that basically simulated real word
software engineering choices. It was a lot of fun and showed the
impact in an interesting way of the investments teams make and the
consequences they can have.
</p>
