When something goes well, make sure you share the credit down and around the whole organization. Let all employees believe they were the ones who did it. They were. Send out awards, phone calls, notes, letters, pats on the back, smiles, promotionsâ€” anything to spread the credit. People need recognition and a sense of worth as much as they need food and water.
