The minute I was bored with a book or a subject I moved to another
one, instead of giving up on reading altogetherâ€” when you are limited
to the school material and you get bored, you have a tendency to give
up and do nothing or play hooky out of discouragement. The trick is to
be bored with a specific book, rather than with the act of reading. So
the number of pages absorbed could grow faster than otherwise.

--Nassim Taleb - Antifragile
